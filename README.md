# Introduction
As a programmer, problem-solving is a crucial skill to have. It requires logical thinking, creativity, and attention to detail. This repository is my collection of problem-solving solutions, which I hope can be useful for others who are learning programming or looking for new challenges.

The problems are organized by category and difficulty level, making it easy to find challenges that match your skill level or interest.

# Problem Categories
The problems in this repository are divided into the following categories:

Data Structures
Algorithms
Dynamic Programming
Graph Theory
Recursion
Sorting and Searching
Each category contains a variety of problems that are labeled by difficulty level. For example, "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard".

# Usage
To use this repository, simply browse the categories and find a problem that interests you. Each problem folder contains the problem statement and a solution file in a programming language of your choice.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference for your own problem-solving practice. However, I encourage you to try to solve the problems on your own first before looking at the solutions.

# Contributing
